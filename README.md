In this project I have created a chatbot 

This is a chatbot application for a beauty studio that allows users to ask questions about booking appointments, available services, pricing, and more. The chatbot provides instant responses. If a question is not recognized, the chatbot collects the user's query for follow-up.

Features
1. Responds to frequently asked questions, such as service booking, pricing, and operating hours.
2. Handles unknown questions and returns a message indicating that the studio will follow up.
3. Built using Flask and Python with a simple web interface.


How to Run
## Install dependencies:
Make sure you have Python installed. To install the required dependencies, run:
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Run the application:
You can start the Flask server by running the following command:
python app.py


## Access the application:
Once the server is running, go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser to access the chatbot.

## Unit Testing
To ensure the chatbot functions properly, unit tests have been created in the test_chatbot.py file. You can run the tests using the following command:
python -m unittest test_chatbot.py
